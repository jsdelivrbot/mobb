# MOBB - My Opinionated Basic Boilerplate
This is an opinionated boilerplate for newbs looking to get into the world of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript development.

## Editor - VS Code
I was loathe to admit it that Microsoft came out with a product that I really, truly like. That being said, when I look at all the trade-offs for an editor, I do not know of another free editor that is as well-supported, full-featured, and active in plugin development. If you're some Vim wizard or Emacs god, fine. Otherwise, use VS Code to get up and running as painlessly as possible.

### Plugins
There are a bunch that I'd recommend, but depending on the project you'll want to enable/disable some via your Workspace Settings.

- Auto Rename Tag
- Babel ES6/ES7
- Beautify
- Bracket Pair Colorizer
- Code Runner
- Color Highlight
- Color Picker
- CSS Peek
- Debugger for Chrome
- Document This
- EditorConfig for VS Code
- ESLint
- Git Blame
- Git History (git log)
- HTML Snippets
- IntelliSense for CSS class names
- JavaScript (ES6) code snippets
- mssql
- npm
- npm Intellisense
- Path Intellisense
- React Native Tools
- React code snippets
- Sass
- TSLint
- vscode-icons

### Configuration: User Settings

### Configuration: Workspace Settings

## Package Manager - npm
With npm implementing a package-lock.json file I, personally, no longer see a need to use Yarn or some other solution.

## Bundling, Minification, Sourcemaps, Transpiling - webpack

## Development Webserver - webpack-dev-server

## Linting - TSLint
